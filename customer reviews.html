                    They have improved a lot and really focused on other cuisine apart from their signature Biryani which is already a hit. Whatever we ordered was top notch. Be it Chinese, tandoori, barbeque, north indian or south indian. Well trained and well behaved staff. Will definitely return for more pleasant surprises

                    searched for lunch during stay at dindigul for a family function. heard lot about this restaurant but never had a chance to go there. so tried here seeing some spacious parking and nice ambience inside the restaurant. mushroom pepper soup, tried veg biryani, pepper mushroom, non veg meals and chicken pallipalayam. well cooked tender chicken and non veg meals came with one omlette two big pieces of chicken 64 and one mutton cola with 3 gravy. costed just 140. veg biryani and pepper mushroom excellent taste. soup was okay. good lunch treat
